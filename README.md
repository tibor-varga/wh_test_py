WH Test Python Repository -- Python test files

Summary:
========

This is a simple repository with multiple sample Python scripts.  These are 
simple scripts that may be used as examples for writing Python programs.  
This project may be public, but it does not yet serve any specific purpose.  
It may in the future....  At this point it includes a bunch of sample 
Python scripts, some based on Python examples.

2)  This project is mainly to experiment with github and with Python.

3)  License for ALL files is GPL, see LICENSE.
