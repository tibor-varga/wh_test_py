WH Test Python Repository -- Python test files
==============================================
Wade Hampton <wadehamptoniv@gmail.com>
10.0, 4/6/2016: updated, readme cleanup

Summary:
--------

This repository contains a collection of sample Python scripts.  These are 
simple scripts that may be used as examples for writing more complex
Python programs.  This project may be public, but it does not yet serve 
any specific purpose.  It may in the future....  

The scripts in this repository are based on samples from various
sources including Stack Overflow, the Python web site, and examples
of stuff that I find interesting.  I have tried to provide links
to the original sources whenever possible.

Please provide feedback on these if you use them or find them 
interesting, including feedback on style, content, errors, etc.

Notes:
------

1.  This document is in AsciiDoc format following my minidoc standard.
    This format is similar to a format that I have used since the 
    1990s.  The standard is in another repository.

2.  This project was created mainly to experiment with github and Python.

3.  License for ALL files is GPL unless otherwise noted, see LICENSE.

4.  Please e-mail me with any updates, suggestions, etc.  

5.  Scripts include generic python, some useful examples, tests with several modules, numpy, and matplotlib.  

6.  After running the scripts, run cleanup.py to remove test files (e.g., sqlite).

7.  The Makefile may be used to clean up (make clean) or build any  
    test programs (TBD -- right very limited).
